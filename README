Current Release:  just about ready to integrate into radtrack ...

jKanban is a jQuery plugin that will drop a Kanban board anywhere in a web page.
All you need to do is supply a RESTful JSON web service to supply card data.


To See The Kanban Board in action, with dummy JSON data, simply open up the file

    examples/simple-kanban/simple-kanban.html

in a browser.


-- This is all well tested javascript code.  See for yourself. --

To run the specs:

    1. In a console window:  "rake jasmine"
    2. Open http://localhost:8888/ in a browser to run the tests

To package up and distribute just the jKanban javascript as a package to use in other applications, use:

   rake dist

and then you'll have a dist/jkanban.tgz in the dist/ directory that you can distribute.
