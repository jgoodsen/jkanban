Current Release:  pre-alpha, prototype stage

jKanban is a pure jQuery plugin that will drop a Kanban board anywhere in a web page.
All you need to do is supply a RESTful JSON web service to supply card data.

  I'm developing jKanban to create a powerful, enterprise kanban board that I'm going
  eventually drop into the hosted service at radtrack.com as an upgraded enterprise subscription option.

To See The Kanban Board in action, with dummy JSON data - check out the examples directory

To run the specs:

    1. In a console window:  "rake jasmine"
    2. Open http://localhost:8888/ in a browser to run the tests
