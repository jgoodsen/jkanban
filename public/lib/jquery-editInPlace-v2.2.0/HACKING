Hacking
=======

To run the teststuite just open [the testrunner](spec/dom.html) in your browser of choice. (I found Webkit Nightlies to be most pleasant to debug in). For more comfort install jspec via `gem install jspec` then you can run `jspec bind --browser <yourprobwser>` in the root directory of the project to re-execute the testsuite whenever you save changes to a file.

If you don't see any tests when executing the testsuite, don't worry, it is set up to only show failing tests.

If you see an enhancement or happen to need one of the things mentioned in the [TODO](TODO) file, please don't hesitate to implement them with a testsuite to boost and send me a patch.
